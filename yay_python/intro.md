# Introduction to Competitive Programming

## About Competitive Programming
In competitive programming, you are given a programming problem and have to code a solution to it. Your program will be given a bunch of inputs, and it must output some correct value. 

Here's an example of a competitive programming contest taken from CCC. CCC (Canadian Computing Contest) is a coding contest held by the University of Waterloo. There are two difficulty levels to CCC, Junior and Senior, the difference being that senior problems are *much harder*

This website aims to show you the basics of competitive programming, with tips to practice.

## A note about programming languages
For the Canadian Computing Contest, you can write your code in Java, C++, C, Python 3, or Python 2. You can write in any of those languages, but keep in mind for tough problems (especially at the Senior level), the compilation time of Python is slow. There's a time limit in which your program must output an answer, so Python may not cut it. We recommend learning C++ or Java, since they have faster execution times (see https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/w4ofli/why_is_c_faster_than_python/)

## A note about this website
This guide assumes you know your chosen programming language well! We try our best to provide code examples for both Java and C++. But this website is still under development, so we apologize if there is missing code in your preferred language.
