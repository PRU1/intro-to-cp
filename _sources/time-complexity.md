# Introduction to Time Complexity

There's a compilation time limit for each programming question. So, we need to design efficient algorithms. Analysing time complexity let's us decide an efficient algorithm to use in a programming problem. 

In a nutshell, time complexity describes how the time it takes to run your algorithm increases as the input size increases. 

For competitive programming, we focus on **Big O Notation**. Big O Notation tells you the *worst* case performance of your algorithm. 
TODO: finish and give examples
TODO: figure out todo tree in vscode (where are all my todos ahhh)







## Summary 
- Time complexity estimates how long a program will take to execute for some given inputs
- Calculating time complexity is useful to find out whether your program will TLE without having to write the program. It helps you explore the fastest solutions
- “Asymptotic upper bound” is used with Big O notation
means the worst possible performance of your algorithm
- Labelled as O(…), where … is some function




There's a lot more to time complexity that we won't touch here! For more info, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk&ab_channel=CSDojo)
